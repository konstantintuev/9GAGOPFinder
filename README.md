# 9GAGOPFinder
## Introduction

This is the source code of 9GAG OP Finder, android app made to find the 9GAG OPs and real OPs with image reverse search of posts in 9GAG. The app is made to work with or without root.
Modded 9GAG apk is in project's *assets* folder and is edited with [apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool "apktool GitHub").

## Motivation

I think that 9GAG community is too full of reposts and disturbing posts and people deserve to know who is the OP or the real OP is.
